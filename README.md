# Calculator
Project for Data Structures at East Tennessee State University

This project is a terminal-based calculator with fairly basic functions.
There is a very primitive system for user variable storage, and I have added testfile.txt
containing some test variables in the correct storage format. While there is no exception handling
currently built into the variable system, it functions as expected. 

In any spot where [number] is given in the format, a variable can take its place.
